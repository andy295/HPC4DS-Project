 --- ENCODING

split text for each processor, 
calculate frequencies individually

join frequencies and sum 

global huffman tree -> no parallelization can be applied

keep global tree and split again 
for each process encode the sequence

"Using such parallel
encoding assumes alignment at block boundaries, so that
some bits may be lost at the end of each block"

this means that we need to decide block size, 
have padding bits to fill the space, 
and also have an END_OF_BLOCK sequence, 
since padding bits may be decodable (error in decoding)

 --- DECODING

let processor i decode block i 
then continue till sync point is reached 
and pass the decoded sequence for joining

in the meantime, processor i+1 has started decoding of block i+1
but from the sync point 
(so we have to pass through the sequence first and check sync presence 
in first block (i guess))
